Since each dataset contains the same columns, we need to combine the datasets into one file. We can't, however, just append the full contents of each file to one final file since each dataset contains the header row. The consolidated file should only contain the header row once (in the first row). We need to instead append the header row to the consolidated file once, then append only the non-header rows from the 3 datasets to the consolidated file.\n",
